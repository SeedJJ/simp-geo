# Local Geo Party (offline GeoGuessr-style)

Update:
- You no longer upload a "global map" at the start.
- Each **round** only needs **one image**: the overall map for that round.
- Host flow: add players → add round (upload map) → set answer → play.

## Run (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
pip install -r requirement.txt
py app.py
```
